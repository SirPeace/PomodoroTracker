2) Rewrite animation based on $duration and $running

Why is there state setting delay in this order on start?
Checkpoint => Timeout => Interval

1) Checkpoint is in a sync code - first
2) Timeout is in an async code with no delay (or not?) - second
3) Interval is in an async code with animation delay - third
